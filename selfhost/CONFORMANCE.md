# Compiler validation

The ordinary CLI uses the [S2 simplification release](../implementation/phase7/s2-report.md).
Its [manifest](dist/release.json) identifies the exact API/source/runtime/host;
`npm run verify:release` checks local integrity and transformation replay.
Fresh checked build, 21 focused paired cases, all component groups, 51 harness
tests and exact cross-version provenance/diagnostic controls pass. The focused
suite retains its seven known exact differences; acceptance is not exact parity.

The [Phase 5 frontend gate](../implementation/phase5/final-artifact-frontend.md)
records 2,756 observations for the earlier artifact, including 318 strict failures.
S1 retained its complete selected API bytes. S2 changes two provenance API roots;
52 of 54 selected roots retain identical reachable generated functions. The
changed routes have 530 new cross-version assertions and the existing 204-check
loader/diagnostic gate. No new broad corpus sweep or full-source B1→H→H proof is
claimed. Historical sections retain their recorded artifact scope.

The supplied baseline compiler results are in [the compatibility matrix](docs/COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md).
Phase 1 changes have separate artifact-specific evidence in the
[implementation report](../implementation/phase1/report.md).
Phase 2 adds [exact paired checks and retained replay](../docs/PHASE2_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with revision-specific results in its [implementation report](../implementation/phase2/report.md).
Phase 3 adds [persistent frontend workers](../docs/PHASE3_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with artifact-specific validation and remaining gates in its
[implementation report](../implementation/phase3/report.md).
Phase 4 separates genuine checked B1, derived development images, native and
self-emitted artifacts in its [report](../implementation/phase4/report.md).
Phase 5 adds the [maintained checked workflow](../docs/PHASE5_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with source-specific repairs, controlled timings and remaining failures in its
[report](../implementation/phase5/report.md).
Its [final-source checked self-reproduction](../implementation/phase5/final-selfhost.md)
has actual equal stage2/stage3 bytes and matching current/frozen source modules;
this is separate from the supplied distribution's historical proof below.
Selected acceptance/phase checks, exact diagnostics, full-corpus coverage and
self-emission are distinct verdicts; none substitutes for the others.
The complete pinned corpus contains 1,378 fixtures across 24 namespaces; all 919
positive fixtures parsed and passed checking in the recorded full run. Exact
execution results, diagnostic differences, timeouts and hardware gates are
reported separately, with artifact hashes.

- [Component verification](dist/component-report.json) checks the assembled Bend source and compiler subsystems.
- [Negative-test audit](docs/NEGATIVE-COMPATIBILITY.md) separates presentation differences, different rejection rules/phases, and unproven intended-rule coverage.
- [Compiler ABI validation](docs/COMPILER-ABI.md) covers the lazy host adapter used by self-emitted compiler libraries. It is separate from the recorded full-corpus run, whose compiler, runtime and host hashes remain explicit.
- [Typed fixed-point verification](dist/selfhost/seed-verification/report.json) records direct checked seed self-emission and byte comparison. [Earlier failed attempts](dist/selfhost/release/report.json) remain separate evidence.
- [Conformance protocol](tools/conformance/README.md) explains reproducible runs and verdicts.
- [Original prototype baseline](docs/PROTOTYPE-BASELINE.md) and [earlier subset survey](docs/PROTOTYPE-SURVEY.md) are historical evidence for the unchecked compiler.

The typed compiler independently passed its complete checked self-rebuild on
2026-09-21: seed and output bytes match exactly. The recorded comparison uses
the same source and Base path layout; relocated checkouts need a local seed.
Passing positive programs does not establish full diagnostic or proof-checker equivalence.
